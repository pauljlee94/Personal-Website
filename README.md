Personal Website V 1.0

This is Version 1.0 of my personal website. This was the first time working on a project of my own.

I mostly used Kevin Powell's "How to Build a Responsive Website from Scratch" and have learned a lot from the project so far.

Things I learened:
-HTML basics
-CSS basics
-How to make responsive websites

Things I want to implement:
-Hamburger menu bar & centered logo with mobile view
-Smooth navigation
-Contact form to my personal email
-Gifs that showcase workflow for projects
-Social media buttons
-Organize CSS rulesets better
-Refactor, organize HTML
